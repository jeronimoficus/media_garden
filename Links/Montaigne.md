# Montaigne

Welcome to Montaigne**.** Make a website, blog, or portfolio using nothing but _Apple Notes_. No more excuses not to have a blog or a website. **Montaigne turns your Apple Notes into a website.** Or you can just share a few notes with your friends or colleagues. [Sign up](https://app.montaigne.io/auth/signin) The steps are simple: 

  1. Create a dedicated folder in the Apple Notes.
  2. Connect it to Montaigne.
  3. Add notes with your content.
  4. Everything will be published to the web automatically.
Once everything is done, you will have a site like [this one](https://podviaznikov.com/). You can also have sites with images, videos, and audio like [this](https://anastasya.montaigne.io).
