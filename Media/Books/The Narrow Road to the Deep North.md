## Annotations

I haven’t read a novel as good or as beautifully written as this. Each word a small weight placed on the reader’s chest, the sensation accumulating with each page.   
  
Have a deep sense of need to get to [@louisianaliterature](https://www.instagram.com/louisianaliterature/) this summer to see him, among others.
