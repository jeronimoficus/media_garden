## Annotations

Coming around to the idea that living the same day over and over would be more freeing than it seems.  
  
Fascinating to watch the rules of the universe unfold in the world Balle created for her protagonist. Canâ€™t believe I have to wait until November or learn to read Danish before the next installment.
