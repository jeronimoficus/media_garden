## Annotations

Translated by [[Polly Barton]]

What I liked about this short novel was the way it surfaces the hilarity of the mundane. The daily innocuous conversations and interactions we have are absurd and funny when read through the voice of someone else. This was also equally challenging to read for the stream of consciousness style of prose. Many very long run on sentences (that add to the humor) but challenged my attention span. As always, Iâ€™m impressed that a translation reads as though it was written in the translated language.
