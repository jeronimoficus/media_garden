## Annotations

Jeez, this is so fucking good.   
  
A memoir about grief told through the history of the concurrent rise of AIDS and the Internet as both real and metaphorical marks in the cultural zeitgeist.   
  
McCalden’s life has been affected by all of these, and yet there are things she learns about her history that are told in such a way that it feels like the reader finds out about them as she does. The effect is as good as any plot twist in fiction. Even the historical and scientific facts, some you probably already know and some that will blow you away, are shared in a way that feels intimately personal. The way it all comes together feels effortless.   
  
You ought to pre-order this.
