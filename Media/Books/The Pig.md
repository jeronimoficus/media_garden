Translated by Erik Butler

Appreciate these two small books I picked up at [@booksaremagicbk](https://www.instagram.com/booksaremagicbk/) this weekend. They had an entire section of translated fiction I loved scouring.   
  
Had high hopes for The Pig that weren’t met, though I’d read the shit out of an Oskar Panizza biography.   
  
Kibogo was great. It reminded me thematically of Willa Cather’s Death Comes For The Archbishop set in Rwanda.
