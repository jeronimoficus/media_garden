## Annotations

“How do we endure living with a mind that can’t stop, starting the moment we’re born until the day we die?”  
  
“I want you to help me find the sound of being alive.”  
  
Strange and disorienting in a good way. A story about how people make their way through the world feeling and dealing with grief.
