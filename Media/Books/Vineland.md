## Annotations
Written as if Pynchon took a prolonged toke and exhaled a cloud of words and characters that landed on the page with some semblance of order and plot amidst a lot of weird shit.   
  
The result is a mesmerizing confusion, which, at least for me, is consistent with other Pynchon novels I’ve read. Whether you find it more mesmerizing or confusing depends a lot on how you come to it. (I picked this up a few weeks ago and had to put it down because I just wasn’t in the headspace for it at the time.)  
  
What keeps me coming back to Pynchon is his perspective on the hidden power dynamics between the state, corporations, and technology (less hidden with each passing day, smh) — the paranoia born from those dynamics, and how that paranoia becomes a protective veil for the whole enterprise.  
  
As most know, Paul Thomas Anderson’s One Battle After Another is a loose adaptation of Vineland, and I’m very excited to see it.
