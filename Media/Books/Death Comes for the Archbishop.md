## Annotations

The geography of the untouched American southwest of the mid-19th Century is an important unnamed character in this book. There are also a number of subtle critiques about human effects on the environment, which seem uncommon and prescient for her time. I’d like to learn more about that.   
  
I especially liked this description of the New Mexican territory’s landscape:  
  
“The sky was as full of motion and change as the desert beneath it was monotonous and still, — and there was so much sky, more than at sea, more than anywhere else in the world. The plain was there, under one’s feet, but what one saw when one looked about was that brilliant blue world of stinging air and moving cloud. Even the mountains were mere ant-hills under it. Elsewhere the sky is the roof of the world; but here the earth was the floor of the sky. The landscape one longed for when one was far away, the thing all about one, the world one actually lived in, was the sky, the sky!”
