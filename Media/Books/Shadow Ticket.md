## Annotations
I grew up near Milwaukee, so a Pynchon novel set here is a real treat for me. The first part is a detective noir with the author blending fascinating history of 1930s Wisconsin with his characteristically absurd and satirical cast of characters. The second part, on the other hand, is pure Pynchonian digression and chaos steamrolling into paranoia, conspiracies, and rising Fascism, and, oh, mind your step for the massive plot blackholes much of the first half fell into. All of this to say, it’s exactly what you’d expect, and I enjoyed it - just go with it!
