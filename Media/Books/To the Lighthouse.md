## Annotations

Not for me, not at this moment. It was challenging to get into a rhythm because of the multifocal narrative perspectives, and nothing really inspired me to meet that challenge (though there were moments of genuine hilarity).   
  
FWIW, the parts I liked the most coincided with my enjoyment of a crisp, cool [@kitesoda](https://www.instagram.com/kitesoda/). I recommend pairing To The Lighthouse with a treat of your choice.   
  
Finally, should this be adapted into a proper film, I think We Anderson would have a good time with it.
