## Annotations

This is the story...of 15 boys...forced to live in an abandoned village...to fend for themselves against a plague...to find out what happens...when people stop being polite...and start getting real...  
  
But seriously, this is very good. The NYT blurb on back cites commonalities between The Plague and The Lord of the Flies, but considering the release of those books just years before, and Ōe’s academic study of French literature, it’s intriguing to consider just how influential he may have found them.
