## Annotations

Rare to look forward to a book as much as I was for this and have it end up being a miss. The conceit and reviews were appealing, and there are definitely incredible scenes and characters, but overall the execution made it hard for me to be engaged like the novel demands. Sometimes a book is not suited for the moment when you pick it up, and thatâ€™s probably what happened here.
