## Annotations

A disorienting story about love, loss, and generational family trauma.   
  
Took a photo of Damion Searls’ translator’s note not just because it sheds an interesting light on the origin of the title and its context within Fosse’s other works, but also because I didn’t even realize the first half’s free-flowing lack of sentences until I read his note. I choose to chalk that up to being absorbed in trying to make sense of the disorienting perspectives rather than a lack of attention :)
