## Annotations

A Danish woman named Elsie Lindtner, at the “dangerous age” of 42, divorces her husband, retreats to a small island in a newly-built villa designed by a younger man (he’s 35) with whom she is secretly in love, but could never be with because of their age difference. She spends a year there, mostly alone, save for her female help and a male gardener who, she worries, smells too much like a man. Maybe it’s the loneliness, maybe it’s the sexual urges she thought she had aged out of, but Elsie reconsiders the role of men in her life. Will it be too late? No spoilers, smh.   
  
Written in 1910 (!!!), it sold a million copies and ran to seven editions in its first ten months of publication. Michaëlis’ novel is witty and feels fresher than most books of its time.   
  
This is an apparently anonymous translation from 1911, reissued by Whiskey Priest in 2011.
