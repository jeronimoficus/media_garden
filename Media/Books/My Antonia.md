## Annotations

At first I thought it was obvious Jim wanted Antonia, but then I started to wonder if Jim (and possibly Antonia) we’re not traditionally aligned with whom they wanted in that way. That made me rethink the story.   
  
Cather reminds me of Hemingway in being able to do so much with so few words. You will not find a superfluous word in any sentence.
