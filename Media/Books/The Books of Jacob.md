## Annotations

Translated by [[Jennifer Croft]]

The last month has been full of transitions for me, and getting swallowed into an epic story of historical fiction was something consistent and familiar to turn to every day, even in small pieces.   
  
The book and story themselves are incredible. It’s a particular part of modern Jewish history I’ve always found interesting, but never dug too deep into. A lot of historical parallels to today, as well.
