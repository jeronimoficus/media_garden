## Annotations

10/16/1989:  
  
“In the midst of the wonderful autumn sun, the resplendent trees, I think of last year. I wanted to make this passion a work of art in my life, or rather this affair became a passion because I wanted it to be a work of art (Michel Foucault: the highest good is to make one’s life a work of art).”  
  
Getting Lost is a journal documenting an affair Ernaux had with an unnamed Soviet man in 1988-‘89. She spares no poetic descriptions about the quality and types of sex (it was very good), but all of that is overshadowed by her anxiety and paranoia about the reciprocity of the affair and its inevitable end. Guessing that kind of anxiety is recognizable by most.   
  
I didn’t enjoy this as much as I hoped.
