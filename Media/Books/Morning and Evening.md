## Annotations

Fosse writes like a chanting conjurer of incantations. Somehow he creates deeply emotional stories and characters with a paucity of words, and double somehow he creates vivid scenes while sparing the words to describe them. All his fiction feels like it takes place in the same concurrent world, where each story is an incident and each character an extra in the others’. It’s kind of insane how he does it. He should get an award or something.   
  
Morning and Evening is beautiful. If you are Fosse-curious or feel daunted by the punctuationally-challenged Septology, I think it’s a great way to test the waters.
