## Annotations

  
This is a book about location and the effects of environs on the people who don’t have much choice on where they are located.   
  
The title, a reference to a nickname bestowed on an apartment complex central to the novel, is also a metaphor for the conditions and consequences of those who inhabit it. That becomes clear later, but the epigraph quoting a memorable scene from the documentary Roger & Me involving rabbits and the person caring for them is foreshadowing for those familiar with the scene.   
  
Roger & Me is a documentary about post-industrial Flint, MI (long before the water horrors everyone knows about now). Flint is a stand-in for many towns in the Midwest that were extremely dependent on industries that once flourished until they suddenly vanished, leaving the people living there holding the bag with little means to go somewhere else.   
  
This is also the story of the fictional town in The Rabbit Hutch, a town probably similar to the one where [@tessgunty](https://www.instagram.com/tessgunty/) was raised. It’s that lived experience and ancestral familiarity that brings the story to life for me. I liked it a lot.
