## Annotations

A counterfactual novel set in 1976 England where The Reformation never happened, science is sinful, and an authoritarian Catholic Church rules all of Europe.   
  
A ten-year old boy has a perfect voice and the Church wants to keep it that way via an “alteration.” Prophetic in its portrayal of assholes obsessed with controlling the sexual identity of children.
