## Annotations

  
I like the story of how [@barackobama](https://www.instagram.com/barackobama/) came across Robinson’s work. As it goes, he’s campaigning through Iowa during the 2008 Democratic primary. Wanting to learn more about Iowa, he picks up Gilead, falls in love with it, and then goes on to win the Presidency, pass Obamacare, avenge 9/11, and appear on a memorable episode of Between Two Ferns. Needless to say, a powerful novel.   
  
In addition, reading Gilead was the beginning of an extraordinary relationship between author and President. Robinson and Obama have publicly interviewed each other, and seem to share a spiritual connection if not a friendship.   
  
I get this connection. While I think I enjoyed Housekeeping more, this is a special book, too. Obama has praised Robinson for showing the “dignity of the struggle to overcome our faults.” I love that, and think it’s particularly apt for Gilead.
