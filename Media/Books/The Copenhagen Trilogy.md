## Annotations

Aspire to write like a poet writing pose.   
  
What is astonishing is how prolific of a writer she was while dealing with the personal tumult and vice grip of addiction described herein. Childhood started slow for me but by Youth I didn’t want to put it down.   
  
All time book jacket, too.
