## Annotations

This was an extraordinary reading experience and nothing I can say here will come close to capturing my thoughts about it.   
  
What stood out for me is the incantational writing. The use of repetitive phrasing is liturgical, and so consistently fluid that the style becomes part of the character’s story.   
  
I got about halfway through the book when it occurred to me that I was picturing everything in black and white, like everything was happening on the moon. It felt intentional and part of the character’s story, and I don’t think I have read anything where I have pictured the story in my mind this way.   
  
I assume all of this is conveyed in the original Norwegian (Nynorsk), and Damion Searls’ ability to capture and translate it without compromising how it’s told is amazing. The book forces you to appreciate the challenges of translation and yet it just unfolds like the prayer I think Fosse intended.   
  
This is a phenomenological novel like In Search of Lost Time and Being and Nothingness and I wonder how much Heidegger Fosse has read.   
  
Get it from [@transitbooks](https://www.instagram.com/transitbooks/) - the new yellow hardcover version looks great.
