## Annotations

Today I learned about the rabbit test (or Friedman test) - an early pregnancy test that involves injecting a woman’s urine into a rabbit, euthanizing the rabbit, then dissecting the rabbit to examine whether its ovaries were enlarged (if yes, then the woman is pregnant). This was less than a hundred years ago. Incredible.   
  
Learned this thanks to Moore’s memoir about her abortion, which took place in 1969. It’s more a psychological examination of her experience, and yet, it’s impossible not to notice the legal and cultural regressions happening around us today.
