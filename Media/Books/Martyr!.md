## Annotations

Akbar writes beautifully. There are portions you’ll start to read with socks on only to be knocked out of them by the end.   
  
My time to read has been especially diminished recently and I wish I had given this more sustained attention. I think it benefits from that kind of reading.   
  
One thing I really loved:   
  
“He read once about a Sufi prayer that went ‘Lord, increase my bewilderment.’ That was the prayer in its entirety.”
