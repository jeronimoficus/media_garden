## Annotations

I did not care for this book.   
  
Vonnegut is at his best when he writes with ironic pathos. Galapagos has the deft of a Mad Lib impression of a Vonnegut story. The quirks and eccentricities are all there, but they feel flat and cheap with nothing of emotional substance supporting them.   
  
I couldn’t wait to get to the end.
