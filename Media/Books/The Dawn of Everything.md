## Annotations

  
There is so much here, and in fact, they planned at least two more sequels, but the untimely loss of David Graeber means this will standalone. It’s more than enough.   
  
I like ideas that are obvious only after someone points out how the obviousness was right under your nose the whole time. That’s this book — the idea that human history, its cultures, politics, and ideas did not evolve in chronological dominos, where one domino neatly falls into another.
