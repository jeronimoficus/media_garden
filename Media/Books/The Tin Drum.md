## Annotations

  
I’ve had the Manheim translation of The Tin Drum sitting on my shelf for 25 years. Finally decided to give it a go, and then a few chapters in I realized the Mitchell translation existed, so picked that up and it’s the one I finished.  
  
This is a novel I think deserving a more proper reading than I could give it. [#life](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/life/) is [#busy](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/busy/) and I spent over a month chipping away at this, not because of lack of interest, just time, focus, and energy. I recommend this if you can give it your full attention.   
  
All that being said, it’s an epic story told around a character, Oskar, that you won’t soon forget.
