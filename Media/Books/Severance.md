## Annotations

I did not care for this.¬†  
  
Of all the problems I had with it, the strangest is the weirdly vivid, repeated description of an otherwise forgettable character‚Äôs penis:  
  
‚Äú[He] took out his Schwarzenegger dick and plowed into me.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI can honestly say it was my favorite body, his dick an ugly sea cucumber, veiny and brown and wretched.‚Äù  
  
üò≥  
  
I sit in silent judgement of the effusive blurbs.
