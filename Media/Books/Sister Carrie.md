## Annotations

Scandalous when published in 1900 for the realistic depiction of human relationships and motivations driven by sex and materialism. Of course the outrage was focused more on Dreiser’s Carrie who went around with a married man (though today I suspect the outrage would be more focused on the coercive kidnapping of Carrie by said married man across international borders under false pretenses, but maybe not!).   
  
The best way to read Sister Carrie, in my opinion, is to frequently remind yourself that this was written 123 years ago. Appreciate how Dreiser broke the fourth wall between how people were assumed to act and how they actually acted.
