## Annotations

Interesting, but didn’t really capture my fancy. It’s an historical novel about a series of earthquakes in Italy in 1976 told through the stories of people who lived through the aftermath. (Rombo is an Italian expression for the underground rumbling preceding an earthquake. )  
  
What I did like a lot was the way Kinsky turns the landscape and nature into characters with stories to tell.
