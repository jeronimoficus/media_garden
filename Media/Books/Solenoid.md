Trans. Sean Cotter

An astounding read. If you’ve read it and want to talk about it, please reach out because there are many things I found fascinating.   
  
Cărtărescu’s imagination and world-building, and Cotter’s translation, just sucked me in and it was precisely the kind of distraction and escape I hoped it would be.   
  
Forgot where I saw it described this way (maybe I imagined it), but the writing is so physiological and physical— the way the body and its parts and processes are described and used metaphorically. It’s so clear and detailed the experience of reading felt physical.
