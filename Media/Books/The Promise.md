## Annotations

galgutâ€™s ability to tell a story without any breaks for scene changes, while dropping in and out of first and third person narration is both amazing and entertaining. each chapter reads like a single, long, unedited tracking shot in a film (eg, goodfellas, 1917). recommend this highly.
