Doing some pro bono PR for [@hbomax](https://www.instagram.com/hbomax/), so if you’re looking for something to watch now that Succession is over, I’m going to be checking out Station Eleven. It airs 12/16 (I think).   
  
The book is phenomenal and you still have time to read it before the show if that’s your thing.   
  
I have not seen any of it, I can only vouch for the story and book.
