## Annotations
Willy Vlautin’s The Horse is the story of Al Ward, a talented but haunted journeyman songwriter in Nevada. Ward struggles with the bottle, his mental heath, and his finances. Still, the guy can write a song and as much as this is a story about Ward, it also is a story of the music industry and what people will do for validation and recognition. Anyone that has chased a dream, or struggled to get by, or currently living that experience, will find something familiar here.   
  
Vlautin ([@the_delines](https://www.instagram.com/the_delines/) / Richmond Fontaine) is a talented singer-songwriter, too, and it shows in his work.
