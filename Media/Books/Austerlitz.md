## Annotations

  
I liked this, but wouldn’t say I loved it. It’s a beautiful story that unfolds predictably and my favorite parts were the tangents about the history of buildings and architecture. The writing reminds me of Marilynn Robinson’s powerful simplicity. I’m very interested in why Sebald chose this particular narrative style (so understated to be unnecessary and even distracting).   
  
But mostly, I couldn’t stop thinking about Austerlitz walking through suburban America in horror.
