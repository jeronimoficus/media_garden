## Annotations

“That world! These days it’s all been erased and they’ve rolled it up like a scroll and put it away somewhere. Yes, I can touch it with my fingers. But where is it?”  
  
- From Emergency, which, twist my arm, is probably my favorite.   
  
The less said about these stories the better as every word is exactly where it should be.
