“Those who write on Heaven’s walls  
should mold their shit in little balls.   
And those who read these lines of wit Should eat these little balls of shit."  
  
I was looking forward to reading this, but for reasons I had a hard time focusing on it. I should have stopped and picked it up later because I am sure I would have appreciated it more.
