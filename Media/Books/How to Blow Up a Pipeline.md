## Annotations

One reading of this title may convey that this is a call to arms. That would be the wrong way to interpret this book.   
  
Instead, it’s an argument for when and how acts of destruction are morally justified. He writes, “It should be explainable and acceptable to enough numbers in some places, and if not today, then surely after a little more of this breakdown.”   
  
That last part is key to me. The future is going to look back at this time with 20/20 vision and know what we knew - that we knew how we got here and knew what to do to mitigate future consequences. The question is whether they will find our actions, what we did with that information and how we communicated it, explainable and acceptable.
