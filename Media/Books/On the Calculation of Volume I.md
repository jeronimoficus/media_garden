## Annotations
Translated by Barbara J. Haveland

To add superlatives to what’s already been said about this would be superfluous, so I won’t, because part of what makes this so captivating is its frugality with words. Its conciseness conjures the evolving moods of the main character as she experiences the same day repeatedly, an eternal recurrence with a twist.   
  
While looking up the blurb on the back from Le Figaro, I was served an ad for a space heater (iykyk). A reminder that we all exist in a world that sometimes feels inescapable.
