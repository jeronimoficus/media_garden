Book 1 of In Search of Lost Time

Translation by Lydia Davis

Poor Swann, clearly a fellow traveler on the anxiety/ADHD path.   
  
Dr Cottard was my favorite lesser character.   
  
“Make cattleya”  
  
“For often, in one season, we find a day that has strayed from another and that immediately evokes its particular pleasures, lets us experience them, makes us desire them, and interrupts the dreams we were having by placing, earlier or later than was its turn, this leaf detached from another chapter, in the interpolated calendar of Happiness.”
