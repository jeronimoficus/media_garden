## Annotations

You probably will find this book enjoyable. Pollan examines and experiments with three plants associated with mind-altering byproducts: opium, caffeine, and mescaline.   
  
The chapter on caffeine is worth reading alone for its history of coffee and tea and how much of the acceleration of capitalism is tied to the rise in the availability of sources of caffeine.   
  
The most fascinating part, though, was mescaline and the [#sanpedrocactus](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sanpedrocactus/), one of its natural hosts (and available in most nurseries). Crazy stuff.  
  
Enjoyed listening to this in Pollan’s voice, too.
