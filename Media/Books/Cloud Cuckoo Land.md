## Annotations

I came into this book with no expectations of what to find or even if it would be something I liked, and in the end it was one that I loved a lot.   
  
A few interesting things:  
  
I swear there is an homage to Vonnegut throughout. A fictional, Google-like company called the Ilium Corporation HAS to be a nod to Vonnegut, and combined with the epic expanse of time in which the story is told and intertwined, I’m even more sure of it. FWIW, Doerr thanks his sons for the name in the acknowledgments at the end.   
  
The other thing is much more a coincidence. There is a small plot line involving a virus and one of the characters involved in that part is named Omicron. Kind of wild.   
  
Lastly- calling out [#finespines](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/finespines/) for the meta-ness (the book is about another book and the spine shows the spine of that book, too).
