## Annotations

Probably not something I would typically read but I was at [@magersandquinn](https://www.instagram.com/magersandquinn/)scrolling through the [@europaeditions](https://www.instagram.com/europaeditions/) feed for recommendations and came across this. The inside jacket said it “shatters tired prejudices about sex, women, and society,” and when I thought about it, my prejudices have been feeling a bit tired lately.   
  
I am glad I read it. It was a quick, engaging, and thoughtful read from a viewpoint impossible for me to know.
