## Annotations

Not my jam.   
  
Felt like everything was coming up George Sand in France, and I’m sure there are good reasons…but I didn’t find any in Indiana.   
  
It is interesting to see how Sand, real name Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin de Francueil, creates her characters with such extreme gender stereotypes — the effect, almost 200 years later, felt a little doth protesting too much to my eyes.   
  
FWIW, George Sand is why there is a George Elliot.
