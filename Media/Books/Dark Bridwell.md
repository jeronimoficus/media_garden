## Annotations

  
I try to avoid sweeping recommendations, but you really should seek out a copy of this Vardis Fisher novel. The characters are so vivid and what seems exceptional to me is the psychological and mental evolution of those characters as a result of the situations he puts them in. This is what separates it from other works of this period that Iâ€™ve read. The Gary Paulsen vibes of the cover belies the intensity and dark humor within.
