## Annotations

Their Four Hearts is not for everyone. It’s a legitimate warning and not a subjective hedge. There are scenes that would deprave the worst of us, and yet, it’s darkly funny and I loved it. It’s a testament to Sorokin that the perversity on the page left me wanting more (or maybe it’s an indictment against me as a reader smh).   
  
The plot, to the extent it can be described, centers around four archetypal Soviet characters banding together on an Indiana Jones-like shit-eating mindfuck (not euphemisms!) of an adventure through the violent and confusing collapse of the Soviet Union. The deviance is balanced by some of the best action writing I’ve read.   
  
This one will stick with you.
