## Annotations
It’s a challenge to write a review of Kitamura’s Audition without any spoilers (the butler did it), so I’m not even going to try. What I will say is that I enjoyed this weird, disorienting novel. Those preferring tightly wrapped endings may be disappointed.   
  
My hot take: what happens between the characters in Audition is just another way of exploring the desires and emotions at the center of Miranda July’s All Fours.
