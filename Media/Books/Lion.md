description: “A breathtaking novel, dreamlike and courageous, brimming with glamour and disastrous scarcities.” —Susie Boyt Lion is the story of a father and a daughter. The father is the unlikeliest of fathers. He is a charismatic bon vivant, a polo player, race-car driver, cocaine addict, ex-con, pilot, and skydiver. He is like a minor god who comes down to earth in a grand manner, falling in all the ways there are to fall. Lion moves back and forth between present-day Los Angeles, where the daughter lives and works as an actress, and the past of her peripatetic childhood in England, Argentina, and Peru. "It is hard to compete with adrenalin when you are a child," she writes, now a mother herself to young children whose settled upbringing prompts her to consider her unconventional youth and the source of its chaos. Sonya Walger's stunning autobiographical debut is an emotionally acute palimpsest of a novel, full of drama and incident, love and tragedy. The legend of the father's life and her distinctive and imaginatively charged telling of it make for an engrossing and unforgettable family saga.

## Annotations

Lion is a beautiful, perfect book and you should read it.   
  
Walger’s autofictive novel is about the narrator’s relationship with her eccentric and complicated father (I kept thinking of him as an Argentinian Royal Tenenbaum). The prose buckles you up from the beginning, and in scenes that bounce around the world and time, Walger reveals a family history rife with pain, but ultimately love and forgiveness.
