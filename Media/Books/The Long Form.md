## Annotations

A book about child-rearing, but really more about attention - how we hold it, capture others’ attention, and navigate the world between the things that demand our attention and the things we want to escape our attention into.   
  
Briggs includes a bibliography/references section, and I appreciated it. More novels should have one.
