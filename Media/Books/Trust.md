## Annotations

Translated from Italian by [[Jhumpa Lahiri]]

loved this.  
  
a short novel built around a simple plot point - a couple in a tumultuous relationship share with each other a secret they’ve never told anyone else in order to tie themselves closer, only to separate shortly after.   
  
also: the afterword by [@lahirijhumpa](https://www.instagram.com/lahirijhumpa/). i wish more translators included a glimpse into how they approached the work and what they especially loved about it.
