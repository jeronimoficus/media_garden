## Annotations
Translated by Hilda Rosner

I wonder if Italo Calvino read The Journey to the East? Kept thinking about Invisible Cities as the narrator described the places and people (real and fictional) encountered throughout. Admittedly, I prefer Calvino’s tighter embrace of magical realism to Hesse’s flirtation.
