## Annotations

I don’t have words for this better than Annie Ernaux’s:  
  
“Reading Sad Tiger is like descending into an abyss with your eyes open. It forces you to see, to really see, what it means to be a child abused by an adult, for years. Everyone should read it.”  
  
Besides the obvious horrors recounted, there are more subtle ones, like the reception for her abuser, the reaction of her small village, and trying to navigate a life where living and remembering are intertwined. It feels trite to call this a brave memoir, but Sinno wields her courageousness like a weapon against those who want to look away.
