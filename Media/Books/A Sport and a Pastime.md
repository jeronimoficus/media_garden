## Annotations

Notwithstanding the title, this is most assuredly not about baseball, though it is filled with metaphorical bats and balls, visits to mounds, vivid accounts of getting to second and third base, as well as multiple home runs. There’s even some thoughtful and delicate discussions about how to best prepare a 2-hole hitter for success.   
  
What separates this from other novels about Americans living it up in France is the unreliable narrator. He’s an American in his 30s, telling the story of another younger American’s affair with a young French woman. He employs his imagination to describe the affair as though he was in the room during their most intimate moments, leaving nothing to the reader’s imagination and keeping open the question of just how much of the story is ultimately a fantasy of his own.
