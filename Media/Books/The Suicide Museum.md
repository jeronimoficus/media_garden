## Annotations

  
I struggled with this. Ostensibly a novel-cum-memoir about the death of Salvador Allende and the tension between memories and truth. If it were just about the mystery surrounding the death of Allende, that would be interesting enough. But there are too many things this book is trying to be — a warning about collective suicide via climate change, for one — that it often felt disjointed and ultimately diluted to me.
