## Annotations

Translated by [[Antonia Lloyd-Jones]]

  
I liked this book, but reading it made me acutely aware of how much external forces in your life can affect your experience of reading, or the mood a book imprints on you.   
  
Many reasons why I never felt like I could get into a rhythm of reading this book despite how much I enjoyed it. There is an astrological theme throughout the plot, but even though it’s not something I subscribe to, it did get me thinking about the humors and competitions for my attention I experienced while reading it.   
  
So who wants to read my chart?
