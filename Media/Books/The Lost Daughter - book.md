I appreciate the acknowledgment of the brutal truth some people experience.   
  
The last line is one for the ages.   
  
I’ve been harping on how they don’t make things like they used to, so I want to call out [@europaeditions](https://www.instagram.com/europaeditions/) because their books are always a pleasure to read, not just for the quality of choice and translation, but because of the care they put into the book itself. The page layouts, the typesetting, and especially the covers. There is an intentional, tactile thingness about their books that make them a pleasure to hold and to read.
