## Annotations

Looking up from my breakfast martini, I realize, “I don’t care for Cusk.”  
  
I tried the Outline trilogy (tiresome), and while this was better, it still feels like a lot (or, in this case, a little) about nothing. But there are times when she puts insights on paper that stop you in your tracks, and that makes the experience of reading her frustrating.
