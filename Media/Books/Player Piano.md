## Annotations

A goal I set for the year is to read all of Vonnegut’s novels in the order they were published.   
  
Player Piano is first, published in 1952.   
  
Here’s a book written 70 years ago about how machines and automation have solved so much work - both physical and mental - that everyone but engineers and managers feel as though their dignity and meaning have been removed from their lives. The main character, the Vonnegutianly named Paul Proteus, is a successful and wealthy engineer who realizes that his own success has resulted in making significantly more people miserable.   
  
The same story could have been written in 2022, which is why I am reading Vonnegut this year.
