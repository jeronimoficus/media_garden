## Annotations

Wasn’t joking when I said I wanted to read everything Mieko Kawakami has written.   
  
Her characters are so good, but what sets them apart is how she depicts them at emotional breaking points.   
  
In both Heaven and Breasts and Eggs, there are scenes where a character hits an emotional wall and responds physically in an absurd way that can only happen at those moments in life. It feels so real and raw and restrained, almost as if she’s writing in slow motion.
