## Annotations

  
I have read a lot about Batuman’s wit and all of it rang true in this book. It’s a mix of pathos and wryness that often made me laugh out loud. I thought the first half was much more enjoyable than the second, primarily because the plot devolves (I think on purpose), and a lot of the dry humor gets lost in the devolution.
