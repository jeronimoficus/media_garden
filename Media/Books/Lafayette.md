## Annotations

Such an incredible life. The Forest Gump of his time ðŸ˜‰Â   
  
The scale and longevity of his influence across two continents at a time when it took at least 24 days to get from one to the other and correspondences took weeks or months to reach their audience doesnâ€™t seem possible in our instantaneous world.Â   
  
His wife Adrienne, whom he was arranged to marry when she was 12 but her mom insisted they wait until she was 14, was equally impressive in her moral character and political instincts.Â   
  
One take away I am left with is the idea that no one is this good of a person and that perhaps Unger fell into a hero worship trap. Beyond the suggestion that Lafayette was blinded by idealism at times, there isnâ€™t much critical of him in the book.
