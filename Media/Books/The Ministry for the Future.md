## Annotations

I did not care for the characters or the narrative aspects of this novel. Regardless, it’s still worth reading for all of the ways and means Robinson speculates the world will combat an irreversibly changing climate.   
  
There’s a lot of applied science, finance, politics and bureaucracy here. It’s not always sexy but a lot of the ideas are fascinating. The depressing thing is that it takes a significant climate event to get people to start seriously implementing those ideas, and even then, it’s painstakingly slow. Cynical me thinks he’s too optimistic about the likelihood of global cooperation.   
  
One thing I do think is prescient is how he imagines a tension between bureaucratic/legislative approaches and climate terrorism - the targeting of people and capital responsible for the crisis. I do feel like there will soon be a fork in the road for how people think about our options.   
  
Anywhoo. Pictured with the book is the wonderful portulacaria afra. Apropos because it’s a carbon sponge. It can use more carbon from the air than most other plants!   
  
Plant more portulacaria afra!
