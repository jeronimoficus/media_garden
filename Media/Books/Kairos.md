## Annotations

Kairos is not so much a love story as it is a story about two peoples’ psychoses, insecurities, and historical circumstances masquerading as love. It’s beautiful and grim - viscerally so, like an episode of Baby Reindeer. Erpenbeck and the translator Michael Hofmann manipulate words and the story like an illusionist and playing cards. How statements and revelations slip in and out of the reader’s attention and return with a gasp made this an especially great read.
