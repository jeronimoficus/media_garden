## Annotations

The Empusium is not much of a horror story despite the subtitle. In fact, it’s not much of anything. The characters are forgettable and miserable and I didn’t get the sense the plot had an idea of where it was supposed to go. It gave me the feeling that The Books of Jacob (which I loved!) may just have exhausted Tokarczuk.
