## Annotations

  
A 1972 TV film inspired by Vonnegut’s writing and characters up to the year it aired. Vonnegut didn’t write the script, but he was an advisor and contributor to it, and so, sadly, he is complicit in this muddled crime against taste.   
  
I did not like it. It felt cheap and forced.   
  
I do want to see the movie if I can hunt it down on the internets.   
  
One fun thing is that the main character is played by William Hickey, who played Uncle Lewis in Christmas Vacation.
