## Annotations

Not my favorite. Could have been my brain this week, but felt like a muddled shit show with a few flashes of brilliance on guns, the police (an early [#ACAB](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/acab/) proponent), and criminal justice. Those moments were not enough to save the plot.  
  
Four more books to go in my [#vonnegut2022](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vonnegut2022/)journey.
