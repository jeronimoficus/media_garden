## Annotations

A readable novel with clichéd unlikeable characters is sometimes what’s necessary in a moment, and I’ve been in one of those ruts.   
  
About the best thing I can say is that in the end, like the play referenced in the title, it’s a true Shakespearean tragedy smh.   
  
Also, I read the Dwight Garner review in the NYT after the fact and it felt like we read different books. It includes this god-awful line:  
  
“Greta Gerwig could film this novel, but so could Quentin Tarantino.”  
  
🤦🙄
