## Annotations

The Recombobulation Area is the beautifully named space in Milwaukee’s Mitchell International Airport that you enter after playing your requisite role in the local rendition of Security Theater.   
  
A designated area for travelers to collectively undo their discombobulation - put themselves back together physically and mentally, maybe mourn what had to be left behind - before heading off to final destinations.   
  
I thought a lot about the Recombobulation Area while reading Anne de Marcken’s genre-bending novel about a newly animated corpse navigating her zombie reality. The main character is the narrator and the story follows her as she attempts to redefine herself, to (literally) put herself back together while mourning imprints of living memories that followed her to the undead.   
  
Funny and remarkable, I liked this a lot.
