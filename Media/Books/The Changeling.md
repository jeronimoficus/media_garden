## Annotations
Joy Williams is so hit and miss for me and I wish it weren’t so. The Quick and the Dead is brilliant, as are some of the short stories I’ve read. Harrow, and now The Changeling, just don’t do it for me. The latter is weird, disorienting, and wandering — not in the ways I enjoy. Maybe it’s not the best time to read it when my brain is already scattered by the disorientation and distortion of the non-fiction we’re being forced to read every day. I hope you find more joy (not sorry) here than I did.
