Somehow I never got to this until now.   
  
It blows my mind this was written in 1932. This edition includes some further reading material at the end, one of which is a letter from AH to Orwell around the time Nineteen Eighty-Four was published. AH writes, “I feel that the nightmare of Nineteen Eighty-Four is destined to modulate into the nightmare of a world having more resemblance to that which I imagined in Brave New World. The change will be brought about as a result of a felt need for increased efficiency.”  
  
Dang.   
  
He also shared with Orwell his idea that the “first hints” of a philosophy of the ultimate revolution…which “aims at the total subversion of the individual’s psychology and physiology” comes from the writings of the Marquis de Sade. Did Foucault read a lot of Huxley?
