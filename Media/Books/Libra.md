## Annotations
A riveting fictionalization of Lee Harvey Oswald’s journey to Dealey Plaza. Swirling with conspiracies and coincidences, it’s easy to see why this event has captured so much attention for decades.  
  
What strikes me most is how modern and contemporary Oswald feels in our current era of weekly mass shootings and the subsequent revelations about shooters’ identities, motivations, and paranoias. He is the archetype of a particular kind of American male we have become all too familiar with.
