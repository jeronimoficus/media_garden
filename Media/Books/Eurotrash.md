## Annotations

“You see in both of us how difficult it is, how impossible it is to confront your parents with the truth. And then to leave it all behind you in decency.”  
  
Eurotrash is a novel about epigenetic angst — the guilt and shame of knowing what’s been inherited from family, and all of the ways we try to deny it. It’s a story told through the relationship and travels of a mother and son, the latter deeply affected by his angst. Often funny, but especially touching, I enjoyed how he comes to peace by better understanding his mother.
