## Annotations

Have only heard good things about these novels, and I can verify those sentiments are mostly true. I enjoyed the first two more than the last two and maybe that’s because the latter focus less on the novel’s eponymous character.   
  
St Aubyn’s Patrick Melrose is introduced in Never Mind as a young victim of unspeakable abuse, and the sadness and trauma chases him throughout.   
  
One theme is the challenge of hereditary trauma and the difficulty of persistence - Larkin’s This Be The Verse hangs over these novels like a cloud.
