## Annotations

Now this is a book to travel with. Calvino creates a historical fantasy centered around conversations between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, where Polo recounts all of the cities he encounters in Khan’s empire. The places he describes are not real, and they have the fantastical feel that reminds me of the different kingdoms in Game of Thrones. This makes it a great book to read in foreign places.   
  
A few weeks back I had the pleasure to see a dance performance inspired by this book. [@thegreatnorthernfestival](https://www.instagram.com/thegreatnorthernfestival/) sponsored a wonderful collaboration with [@ashwiniramaswamy](https://www.instagram.com/ashwiniramaswamy/) and [@kevorkmourad](https://www.instagram.com/kevorkmourad/). The performance also included my talented friend [@bcahlgren](https://www.instagram.com/bcahlgren/), and the incredible breakdancing of [@mnjoe88](https://www.instagram.com/mnjoe88/).
