## Annotations

Everyone at the pool reading Lessons in Chemistry but not me.   
  
An insightful, honest, and vulnerable collection of 19 interviews between [@pollybukuro](https://www.instagram.com/pollybukuro/) and her unnamed interlocutors about their relationships and history with porn. The taboo of talking about porn is real, and too often tied to shame and embarrassment, but people open up to Barton and that’s why this works. All credit to Barton for her openness and willingness to be vulnerable about the subject.
