## Annotations

Recently moved into a new home where the previous owner left us some old books, including a stack of Steinbeck novels. Normalize leaving great books on the shelf when you move!  
  
The Winter of our Discontent is one I picked up last Wednesday morning apropos of everything everywhere, and thank goodness for that. I found it so, so good. Written in response to the “moral degeneration” of American culture during the ‘50s and ‘60s, it’s remarkable how well it continues to be a critique of the compounding degeneration. Ethan Allen Hawley, the main character, gives cynical George Bailey vibes (I realized early I was reading his voice like Jimmy Stewart, smh). Highly recommend.
