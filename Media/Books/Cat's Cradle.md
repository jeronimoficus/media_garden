## Annotations

As it happened, or as Bokonon would say, as it was meant to happen, this was a strange week to read Cat’s Cradle. I’ve been glued to the news coming out of Ukraine, and there were times that it felt hard to concentrate on this or anything else.   
  
But who better to read when the world feels irrational, stupid, and hard to believe than a guy like Vonnegut who felt it in every word he wrote.   
  
Bokonon is the satirical prophet of the satirical religion in Cat’s Cradle. Throughout the book are many oft-quoted Bokononisms, and this one sums up a lot about how I feel about things these days:  
  
“Sometimes the pool-pah,” Bokonon tells us, “exceeds the power of humans to comment.” Bokonon translates pool-pah at one point in The Book of Bokonon as ‘shit storm’ and at another point as ‘wrath of God.’”
