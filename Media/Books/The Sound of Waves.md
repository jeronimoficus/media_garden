## Annotations

What strikes me about this beautiful novel is how Mishima never quite lets you pin down when it’s happening. There are little hints that pull you back to reality, but the way he captures both the small details and the overwhelming presence of this remote Japanese island makes it feel like it could be happening anytime. It reminded me of Cather’s Death Comes for the Archbishop and Hugo’s The Toilers of the Sea in that way.  
  
The story itself is simple but powerful. Be the Shinji in a world full of Yasuos.   
  
Translated by Meredith Weatherby.
