## Annotations

  
I like trees. I’m continually fascinated by Simard’s research into how trees communicate, help, and depend on each other through mycorrhizal networks. If you are familiar with her findings you won’t learn a lot of new things, but I really enjoyed the story of how she came to her research and conducted her studies.   
  
One thing on my mind lately is the perspective we as intelligent, cultured, evolved people have about those in the past who treated animals and nature as gods. Seems to be a tendency to write that off as not knowing any better. Maybe the noises and distractions of modern life blind us from what otherwise would be obvious if we were more tuned into non-human living things. Maybe Simard just put a scientific point on what a lot of people throughout history already knew through intuition and observation.
