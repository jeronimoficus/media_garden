## Annotations

It was fun to join [@samxbxg](https://www.instagram.com/samxbxg/)and his [@withwhatisother](https://www.instagram.com/withwhatisother/) book club to read and discuss this short, interesting book.   
  
This is about the weight of transitions — generational, political, cultural, geographical, psychological, and ultimately, I think, the one from life to death. The latter seems to hang over the narrator throughout, often hiding behind the psychological deterioration that keeps her in and out of mental institutions.   
  
All of this is a lot for one person to handle, and Ozlü’s use of an unreliable narrator conveys the detachment (and maybe even delusions) of someone struggling to ground themselves in a sea of changes.   
  
Translated from Turkish by Maureen Freely, with an incredible cover by Sarah Schulte ([@sarahcschulte](https://www.instagram.com/sarahcschulte/)).
