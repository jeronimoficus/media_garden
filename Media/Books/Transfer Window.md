## Annotations

Transfer Window captures in both style and substance the slow degradation of life by terminal illness. Set in a not unrecognizable future Copenhagen, where the northern suburbs have been turned into an open hospice, the dying separate themselves from their old, healthy lives and wait to die.   
  
The narrator’s account of her cancer and the coming to terms with her imminent death is told through brief vignettes. This style packs a lot of punch for a dearth of words. There’s also a blurring of what’s being experienced now vs what’s being recalled that often mimics the end of life.   
  
A beautiful, sad book from a brilliant recommendation.   
  
Lastly, it’s hard not to read this through the experience of the author, Maria Gerhardt. She was born a year before me, and died from cancer in 2017, shortly before this was published. This book epitomizes the adage ‘may her memory be for a blessing.’
