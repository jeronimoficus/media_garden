## Annotations

A novella about chess, but really monomania from both an individual and authoritative viewpoint. Zweig wrote this in exile in Brazil (escaping the Nazis in Europe) and died by suicide with his wife shortly after sending in the manuscript. Hard not to let that affect how itâ€™s read.
