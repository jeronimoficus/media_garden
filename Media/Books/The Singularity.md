## Annotations

A challenging novel to read about otherness and the refugee experience. It’s a story of two women, unknown to each other but connected through a moment of profound sadness. Both women share the experience of being the other, of being refugees in places unlike their homes, though each are in different stages of that experience.   
  
Karam’s chosen narrative style can be disjointed and sometimes jarring. I found this difficult at times, but the style mirrors the experiences of the characters and in that way it really adds a soft power to the story.
