## Annotations

A wonderful memoir and a reminder to write everything down and encourage others to do so, too. The nature of dandelions figures prominently, both metaphorically and practically. I was unaware of how common they are in drinks and salads â€” maybe a European thing? I have big culinary plans for next spring.
