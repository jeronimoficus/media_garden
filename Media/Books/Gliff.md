## Annotations

First time reading Ali Smith.   
  
Contemporary dystopian novels have started to blend together for me. Two reasons for this. First, look around at what’s happening and how quickly it feels things are moving. Second, writers reacting to this in a way that results in dystopian herding where everyone starts to describe a society that feels similar to the others’.   
  
There are moments where Gliff very much feels stuck in this dystopian herd, but credit to Smith’s writing for making this challenging and rewarding, and ultimately carving out a unique space in the genre.
