## Annotations

Kitamura’s narrator is an interpreter, and one of the many layers of intimacies alluded by the title is the relationship between an interpreter and to whom (and what) they are interpreting. I think the intimacy of interpretation/interpreting and translation/translating is often overlooked because it’s the noun and not the verb that usually gets our attention (the ends overshadow the means smh). If you’re someone who thinks everything is an interpretation, then this opens up possibilities for all sorts of intimacies we may overlook.   
  
I liked this a lot.
