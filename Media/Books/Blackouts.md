## Annotations

I have mixed feelings about this.   
  
Torres’ story is inventive and original and brings to light a topic I found fascinating and knew nothing about: the early 20th century work of Jan Gay, a lesbian who interviewed and documented the experiences of lesbians throughout Europe and North America.   
  
Gay’s efforts to get her work published, how it came to include the study of men, how it was co-opted by others, and led to conclusions that established the maladjustive deviancy of homosexuality contra to what her own research found is the story I found myself wanting to read. Instead, I felt Torres’ story touched it too obliquely and my wanting to know more dampened my enjoyment of the story he was telling.
