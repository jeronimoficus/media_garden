## Annotations
Beautiful and full of awe. What I appreciate most about Steinbeck is how easy he makes everything seem. What he conjures with simplicity makes you wonder why everyone doesn’t write this way, but of course that’s his magic.  
  
Lee is not just one of my favorite characters in literature, but also an aspiration. All of the characters are wonderful (Samuel and Cathy, in particular); though interesting to see the diminishing focus on the Hamiltons in the later parts of the book. Curious what people think about that.
