## Annotations

Everett is so good at playing with words, characters, and absurdity. I wonder if for him it’s a self-medicating way of being in the world. He reminds me a lot of Vonnegut in this way.   
  
I did some digging on that comparison and learned Everett is a big fan and read him widely. In hindsight, this shouldn’t be a surprise. My kinship with Everett and Vonnegut is in the recognition that existence is kind of fucked up, and what’s even more fucked up are the injustices and horrors we’ve created as we’ve made our way through the world. I think both Everett and Vonnegut recognize that the only accurate way of describing how things are, both the good and the bad, is by embracing the fact that existence is inherently satirical.   
  
(Twain -> Vonnegut -> Everett)  
  
Anyway, I loved I Am Not Sidney Poitier. Please read more Everett.
