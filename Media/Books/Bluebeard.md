## Annotations

- Better than Galapagos (low bar).   
- Rabo Karabekian is a classic Vonnegut protagonist.   
- A lot of great musings about aesthetics.   
- Still kind of meh.   
  
I have been wondering if reading all of Vonnegut’s novels this year has prevented me from singularly enjoying them. The novelty and eccentricity (except for a select few) wear off and it just feels too formulaic and tired.   
  
I think Vonnegut knew this, too. There’s a page in the front matter of Bluebeard listing his previously released novels that ends with the parenthesis “(Enough! Enough!)”.   
  
A self-referential joke that’s also a spoiler.   
  
Two more to go.
