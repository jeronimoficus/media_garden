## Annotations

Finished this sitting outside the National Willa Cather Center in Red Cloud, Nebraska. Probably my favorite novel of hers that Iâ€™ve read. Fascinating ending. Cather lived here for only ten years which is hard to believe given how vivid and real her characters and landscapes endure.
