## Annotations

fun fact: for the longest time I wanted to be a cartographer when I grew up. I’ve loved maps for as long as I can remember, and have a box of atlases I made packed away somewhere. I’ve always loved how different maps can share a subject but be endlessly unique.   
  
It’s clear that Peng Shepherd loves maps, too, and that makes this book enjoyable to read.   
  
Approach it like getting into a warm bath. Get in and let go, and just enjoy it (and roll with some of the predictable plot-twists). The story is worth it.   
  
Also, a fascinating true story underlying the fiction, but no spoilers.
