## Annotations

Big supporter of dystopian themes in YA literature! I suspect this book hits different to readers today than it did when it was released 30 years ago. I didn’t read it then but I don’t think it would have fucked with me as much as it did today. Looks like they made an awful looking movie a few years ago, which is disappointing.
