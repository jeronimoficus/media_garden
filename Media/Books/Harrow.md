## Annotations

Strange, disorienting, dystopian, apocalyptic, and funny.   
  
I want to read more Williams stories.   
  
Two things:   
  
- “Future humans, such a reckless concept.”  
  
- As of last week, I had never heard of a chamois before it was mentioned in Marlen Haushofer’s The Wall. Lo and behold, Williams referenced one, too.   
  
A chamois is a goat-antelope found in Europe, by the by.
