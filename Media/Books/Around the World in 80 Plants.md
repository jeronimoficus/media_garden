## Annotations

Can’t say enough about the writing of [@jondroriuk](https://www.instagram.com/jondroriuk/) on plants and trees (and the beautiful illustrations by [@lucille_clerc](https://www.instagram.com/lucille_clerc/)).   
  
Someone please fund a State-side speaking tour for Jonathan.   
  
This is the follow up to the eye-opening Around the World in 80 Trees, and is equally filled with incredible history, science, and most of all, reminders of the existential interdependence between human history and the natural world.   
  
Too many interesting things to call out, but I’ll tease one: Most Cook Pines (Araucaria columnaris) tilt toward the Equator, and the further north or south they’re found, the more pronounced the lean (pines found in Hawaii stand relatively upright compared to pines in Australia). Why? Nobody knows.
