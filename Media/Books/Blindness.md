## Annotations

A challenging read worth the effort. I did not know much about Saramago, and didn’t know that he eschewed proper names for characters, or even a conventional structure for dialogue. At times it feels like he doesn’t even believe in sentences (see second image). So it took some time to get used to but when I did, the book took off for me.
