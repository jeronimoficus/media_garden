## Annotations
Yeesh, this is so good. A wickedly funny, autofictitious accounting of Blackwood’s younger years growing up during the waning of the Anglo-Irish aristocracy (her mother was a Guinness heiress).  
  
There are a lot of similarities to Sebald’s Austerlitz, in my opinion. The way in which both stories are told through the voices of others, and each is ultimately about the search for missing and incomplete familial origins. If you enjoyed Austerlitz, I think you’ll like this, too — I liked it even more, and not just because of the humor.  
  
(Fans of The Big Lebowski will appreciate the ending - and I’d love to know if the Coens have read this).
