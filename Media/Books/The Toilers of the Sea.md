## Annotations

I’ve been toiling away at life for a few weeks, escaping into this book not nearly as much as I would have liked. I never minded, though, because this book is wonderful. I loved everything about it, and it’s a new favorite.   
  
It has some of the most beautiful writing about the power of nature I’ve read, and a main character— Gilliatt — I won’t forget. Even the first section on the differences between the Channel Islands is standalone awesome. Highly recommend this.
