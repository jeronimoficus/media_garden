## Annotations

A stirring meditation-as-memoir about the consequences of circumstance. If you have not yet read the assigned reading (The Narrow Road to the Deep North), I insist you read that before this. Think that order maximizes the enjoyment of both.   
  
I don’t have the money for the legal team required to post all of the excerpts I’d like to share, so settling for this amazing bit about H.G. Wells and Kurt Vonnegut. Almost feels too perfect to be true, and I want to keep it that way so if you’re aware of an artistic license being used in this anecdote I don’t want to know about it.   
  
And speaking of artistic licenses, readers of Labatut’s When We Cease to Understand the World and The MANiac might see this excerpt and notice a similarity of style. They would not be wrong - much of Question 7 reads like Labatut, almost uncomfortably so. As someone swept up in how those stories were told, I’m not complaining, but eyebrows were raised.
