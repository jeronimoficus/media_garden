## Annotations

Translated by Chris Andrews

Love the new [@picador](https://www.instagram.com/picador/) series of Bolaño’s catalogue, and especially the covers by [@michael_schmelling](https://www.instagram.com/michael_schmelling/). I want them all.   
  
Stylistically these books couldn’t be more different, and demonstrate Bolaño’s range. The Insufferable Gaucho is a collection of short stories and two lectures, all of which I found phenomenal. They are written with intention like a choreographed dance moving purposefully from start to finish. My favorites (if I had to choose) were Alvaro Rousselot’s Journey and Literature + Illness = Illness   
  
Antwerp was completely different, also his first novel, though published 20ish years after first writing it. Written as a series of small vignettes without a sense of chronology or consistent characters, I found it more of an exercise in evoking emotions than a narrative project.
