## Annotations
I kept thinking about Dorothy Thompson’s 1941 Harper’s essay, “Who Goes Nazi?” while reading this inventive novel-as-encyclopedia of fictional writers who veer to the far right. Thompson writes, “Nazism has nothing to do with race and nationality. It appeals to a certain type of mind.”  
  
This is certainly true of Bolaño’s subjects. Like those Thompson observes, some were probably born this way, while others came to embrace these views out of some perceived slight or even boredom. Whatever their reasons, Bolaño’s writers are sometimes pitiful, often funny, and yet frighteningly normal.   
  
Clearly inspired by Borges’ A Universal History of Infamy- I think you should read both.
