## Annotations

Instagram’s new recommended music algorithm suggested Bob Marley’s Sun is Shining as an appropriate accompaniment to this photo. I for one welcome our new sardonic AI overlords.   
  
I came to this embarrassingly ignorant about Plath and the book, in general. Of course, I knew of her and the basic outlines of her life and death by suicide, but the details in this semi-autobiographical novel, and particularly the metaphor of the bell jar were especially revealing. “I’ve tried to picture my world and the people in it as seen through the lens of a bell jar.”  
  
And then there’s the incredible details left out of the novel. The lack of sufficiently appropriate obituaries and the speculative reasons for it, the asshole Ted Hughes, the attempts to delay or even prevent publication in the U.S., and the weird twist that Plath lived and died in Yeats’ old house. I found it all equally fascinating and horrifying and sad. I wonder how this book would be written and received in today’s world.
