## Annotations

A historical novel set in mid 1970s India during “The Emergency” - period of 21 months when the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi effectively suspended her country’s burgeoning democracy and civil liberties. I had no idea about any of this. Mistry’s characters and the way he brings their lives together through social unrest is memorable.
