## Annotations

More experimental than I needed today, though did enjoy how it’s entirely written as stream of consciousness snippets.   
  
I probably will remember this forever:  
  
“So writing is the method of using the word as bait: the word fishing for whatever is not word. When this non-word — between the lines — takes the bait, something has been written.”
