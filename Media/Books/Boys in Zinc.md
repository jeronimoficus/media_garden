## Annotations

This is not a beach read. A history of the Soviet war in Afghanistan told through interviews with people who were there. Controversial when it was released because this was a story that had not been told before with this level of personal truth.   
  
Fascinating and horrifying how universal the experiences of war are to those who fight them and their loved ones at home.   
  
This reminded me in many ways of Tim O’Brien’s The Things They Carried.
