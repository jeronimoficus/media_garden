Someday in our dystopian future, a generative AI application will write books specifically targeted to weave all of our interests into a unique, captivating and imaginative narrative. While we wait, there is, for me, North Woods by Daniel Mason.   
  
Some of the best writing about nature I have ever read in a work of fiction, and a conceit that works in parallel even when it feels like it’s trying to test the limits of the reader. Last but not least, stick around for the hottest sex scene involving beatles I’ve read this year.
