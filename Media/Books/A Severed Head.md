## Annotations

A shit show (complimentary) and a clusterfuck (licentiously). I liked this a lot.   
  
Interesting to me that this was published just before Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? because there were scenes and interactions reminiscent of the relational tension expressed in the play, albeit (smh) here the situations are much different.   
  
And what a cover.
