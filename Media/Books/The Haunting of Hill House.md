## Annotations

“No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream.”  
  
What an opening sentence.   
  
This was as good as advertised. In hindsight, what hasn’t been influenced by Jackson? (Thinking this especially as I watch Yellowjackets).
