‚ÄòThe word: she tried to prevent it sounding in her thoughts, and yet it danced through them obscenely, a typological demon, juggling vague, insinuating anagrams ‚Äî an uncle and a nut, the Latin for next, an Old English king attempting to turn back the tide‚Ä¶the smallest pig in the litter, the hounds pursuing the fox, the flat-bottomed boats on the Cam by Grantchester meadow. Naturally, she had never heard the word spoken, or seen it in print, or come across it in asterisks‚Ä¶The smooth-hollowed, partly enclosed forms of its first three letters were clear as a set of anatomical drawings. Three figures huddling at the foot of the cross.‚Äù
