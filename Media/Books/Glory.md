## Annotations

All the characters are animals (but Animal Farm, it is not). Set in a fictional, contemporary African country with modern online culture and media (Twitter, Siri, etc), it draws inspiration from the end of the Mugabe era in Zimbabwe.   
  
Bulawayo’s writing SINGS. I mean that literally. She is wonderful.
