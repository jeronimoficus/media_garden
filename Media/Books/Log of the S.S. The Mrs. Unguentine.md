## Annotations

So much bizarre and comic world-building and character development packed into one hundred pages. I really enjoyed this.   
  
Loved [@mathgun](https://www.instagram.com/mathgun/)’s description of Crawford in the Afterword:  
“Unusually capable of uncoiling his brain and repacking it in his head in a new, gnarled design for every book he wrote.”
