## Annotations

Heavier and more poignant than other Everett books I’ve read, and equally brilliant. I loved this.   
  
Crazy backstory: There are three different but similar versions of this book all published at the same time. Some of the wording is changed, each has its own dedication, some plot points are different, chapter titles changed…generally the same novel but slightly different tellings like the game of the same name as the title.   
  
Percival Everett is fantastic.
