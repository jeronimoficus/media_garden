## Annotations

‚ÄúIt had never occurred to me that words, too, must be salvaged, though when I thought about it, it seemed obvious. It was absurd to think that things were held in place, are held in place, by a web of words.‚Äù  
  
One of those books you pick up and can‚Äôt put down and then wonder how it ever escaped you.¬†  
  
That some MAGA-school board member somewhere hasn‚Äôt tried to ban it for the name of the town (Fingerbone) is, I think, a testament to Robinson‚Äôs subtlety üòâ.
