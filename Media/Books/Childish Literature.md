## Annotations

This hit the spot. A collection of essays and stories (there’s even a poem) about the relationships between father and child and child and father. Zambra is the kind of dad I want to have dad beers with.   
  
‘Introduction to Football Sadness’, a story first published by [@mcswys](https://www.instagram.com/mcswys/), is excellent and eminently identifiable to me.   
  
Fwiw, this would be a good gift for the Disappeared Literary Man™ in your life, smh.
