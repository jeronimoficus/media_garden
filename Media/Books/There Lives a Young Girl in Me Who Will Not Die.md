## Annotations

Blown away by this collection of Ditlevsen’s poetry. She is direct, clear, and biting with her words. She makes you feel seen with a light that cuts through you.   
  
My one wish for translated poetry - side-by-side juxtaposition in the original language.   
  
Translated from the Danish by Sophia Hersi Smith and Jennifer Russell.
