## Annotations

A real journey. I preferred the war parts to the peace bits, loved *both* epilogues, and especially intrigued by Tolstoy’s fatalistic view of history, the romantic ways he describes it, and the consequential (smh) limits of free will.   
  
That someone espousing these views could write this description of someone knowingly about to be executed is something I will think about a lot:  
  
“As they were putting his blindfold on he shifted the knot himself because it was digging into the back of his head, then, when they backed him up against the bloodstained post, he half-fell into an awkward position, pulled himself together, squared his feet and settled back comfortably.”
