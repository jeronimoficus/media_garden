## Annotations

Blackwood writes with such clean and precise prose, which, in the voice of her brutally cutting narrator, packs an extra blunt punch. Don’t be fooled by the straightforward simplicity or length of this short debut novel — it’s darkly funny and a deeply emotional portrayal of a woman struggling with the transition of a divorce.   
  
I think a lot of you would enjoy reading Caroline Blackwood.
