> Richard Keller, a medical historian at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, says that much of the current pandemic rhetoric—the [premature talk of endemicity](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/02/endemicity-means-nothing/621423/); the [focus on comorbidities](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/covid-cdc-disability-comorbidity-anger-1282759/); the [_from_-COVID-or-_with_-COVID debate](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/01/for-covid-with-covid-hospitals-are-mess-either-way/621229/)—treats COVID deaths as dismissible and “so inevitable as to not merit precaution,” [he has written](http://somatosphere.net/2022/memorializing-death-mass-mortality-covid-keller.html/). “Like gun violence, overdose, extreme heat death, heart disease, and [smoking](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/02/covid-anti-vaccine-smoking/622819/), [COVID] becomes increasingly associated with behavioral choice and individual responsibility, and therefore increasingly invisible.” We don’t honor deaths that we ascribe to individual failings, which could explain, Keller argues, why national moments of mourning [have been scarce](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/24/1066223330/biden-covid-deaths-memorials). There have been few pandemic memorials, save some moving but temporary [art projects](https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2021/09/photos-covid-19-memorial/620146/). Resolutions to turn the first Monday of March into a COVID-19 Victims and Survivors Memorial Day have stalled in the [House](https://stanton.house.gov/_cache/files/5/b/5bf950ea-3bd4-402a-8de1-7ea13637a69e/A79E35386CF00BC532BC7CA56AD0D5FB.stanaz-007-xml.pdf)and [Senate](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/WIL21831.pdf). Instead, the U.S. is engaged in what Keller calls “an active process of forgetting.” If safety is now a matter of personal responsibility, then so is remembrance.
