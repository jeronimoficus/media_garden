In a letter to her student, Hadrien, Josephine writes:

> I just have one small recommendation to make. Be careful, desire is a fickle thing.  And sometimes, it has nothing to do with happiness. We all have to learn not to desire what's going to bring us suffering (read the Stoics), and we also have to learn to better understand our own desires (read Spinoza). Don't forget that a poorly understood desire is one that pushes us towards what seems to be good for us, but is bad in reality.
