description: "Winner of the PEN Center USA West Award for Fiction â€“ a collection of fifty-three interconnected stories by the National Book Award-winning author of Europe Central Hailed by Newsday as &quot;the most unconventional--and possibly the most exciting and imaginative--novelist at work today,&quot; William T. Vollmann has also established himself as an intrepid journalist willing to go to the hottest spots on the planet. Here he draws on these formidable talents to create a web of fifty-three interconnected tales, what he calls &quot;a piecemeal atlas of the world I think in.&quot; Set in locales from Phnom Penh to Sarajevo, Mogadishu to New York, and provocatively combining autobiography with invention, fantasy with reportage, these stories examine poverty, violence, and loss even as they celebrate the beauty of landscape, the thrill of the alien, the infinitely precious pain of love. The Atlas brings to life a fascinating array of human beings: an old Inuit walrus-hunter, urban aborigines in Sydney, a crack-addicted prostitute, and even Vollmann himself."
