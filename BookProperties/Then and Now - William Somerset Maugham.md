description: A novel which finds a parallel to the turmoil of the 20th century in the duplicity, intrigue and sensuality of the Italian Renaissance. Maugham enters the world of Machiavelli and covers three important months in the career of that crafty politician, worldly seducer and high priest of schemers.
